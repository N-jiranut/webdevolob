      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Individuals with hearing impairments often face significant communication challenges in their daily lives, especially when interacting with people who do not understand sign language. This limitation affects their access to education, healthcare, employment, and social participation. Although sign language serves as a primary communication tool within the deaf community, the lack of accessible translation systems for real-time interaction with non-sign language users remains a barrier.
        This project was initiated after a field observation at Setsatian School for the Deaf, where our team gained firsthand understanding of these communication difficulties. The experience highlighted the urgent need for a technological solution that could facilitate independent, face-to-face communication between hearing and hearing-impaired individuals without relying on human interpreters.
        In response, we proposed the development of the Immediate Sign Language Translation Assistant for the Deaf, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enable real-time translation of sign language gestures into text or voice. The system uses computer vision to detect hand and applies trained ML models to recognize sign language with high accuracy. In future development, the model will be refined with supervised learning from sign language interpreters to improve performance in interpreting full sentences and maintaining contextual meaning.
        With the integration of both hardware (gesture detection via camera of IPAD) and software (AI processing and web-based interface beyond in IPAD and Laptop), this innovation aims to provide an accessible and scalable solution that enhances communication, promotes inclusivity, and supports hearing-impaired individuals in their everyday interactions.
